  body: `I don’t think I ever properly told you this, but life genuinely feels lighter since you became a part of it. Not louder, not dramatic — just calmer, safer, and more real. Somehow, even ordinary days feel easier to get through when I know you exist in them.

You have this quiet way of noticing things — especially me. You catch my silence before I explain it, my sadness before I admit it, and my mood even when I try to hide it behind jokes. That itself means more to me than you probably realize. There are moments when just you asking “what happened?” fixes something inside me that I didn’t know was hurting.

Thank you for the care you give so naturally — the kind that doesn’t make noise, but stays. Thank you for the hugs that say more than words, for standing by me in ways that feel effortless to you but unforgettable to me. You don’t try to fix everything, and that’s what makes you special — you simply stay, and that is enough.

I hope you always know this: you never have to be strong all the time, and you never have to explain yourself to be understood. I’ll always wish for your happiness, your peace, and the gentle smile you carry without realizing how powerful it is.

Just be with me always, don’t leave me 😖. You mean a lot to me in my life — more than anyone ever has 🥺.`,
